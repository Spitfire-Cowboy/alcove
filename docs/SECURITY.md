# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.3.x   | Yes       |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Email security reports to the repository owner via GitHub private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Pro777/alcove/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Describe the issue, steps to reproduce, and impact

You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand the scope and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

## Security model

Alcove is local-first. Your data never leaves your disk.

The architecture assumes the operator owns the hardware, controls the storage, and decides what enters the index. We do not want your data. This is not a feature; it is a design constraint.

### What Alcove does

- Stores documents and vectors on local disk only
- Runs a local web server bound to the configured host/port
- Makes no outbound network calls (unless using `sentence-transformers`, which downloads a model on first use)

### What Alcove does not do

- Authentication or authorization. The API is open to anyone who can reach the port.
- Encryption at rest. Use OS-level disk encryption.
- Input sanitization beyond the documented attack surface.

### Known attack surface

| Surface | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| XSS in search results | `html.escape()` before `<mark>` insertion | Implemented |
| Path traversal via file upload | `Path(filename).name` strips directory components | Implemented |
| File type validation | Extension allowlist on upload | Implemented |
| API is unauthenticated | Bind to localhost in production; use a reverse proxy if you need authentication | Documented |
| ChromaDB telemetry | Disabled by default (`ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False`) | Implemented |

### Operator responsibilities

- Bind `alcove serve` to `127.0.0.1` if not behind a reverse proxy
- Use OS-level disk encryption for data at rest
- Keep dependencies updated (`pip install --upgrade alcove-search`)
- Do not expose the API to the public internet without adding authentication

## Non-claims

Alcove is not a security product. It does not provide enterprise IAM, compliance controls, or audit logging. Alcove handles search. You handle custody.
