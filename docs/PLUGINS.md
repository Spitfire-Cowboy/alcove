# Plugin Ideas & Domain Recipes

Potential Alcove plugins and the use cases that motivate them. Not all are implemented — this is a catalog of what's possible given the plugin architecture.

> **Gate question for every plugin:** "Has the community already solved this, or do we need to build it ourselves?"

Alcove is domain expert in one thing: its own source code. Everything else is a plugin. Two principles apply: wrap existing domain tooling rather than rebuilding it, and prefer a **view layer over a copy layer** — store manifests with provenance metadata, not duplicated data.

Two system boundaries that apply to every plugin:

- **Retrieval only.** Plugins index and return documents. They do not perform generative transformations on content.
- **Offline by default.** Alcove makes no outbound network calls unless a plugin explicitly requires one (e.g., an API fetch at ingest time). Plugins must not send corpus data to external services.

Plugins are trusted code. Installing a plugin is closer to installing a Python package with execution privileges than to enabling a harmless data filter. Plugins can parse local files, influence index contents, and, if written to do so, access the network or alternate storage systems.

If you want to narrow what Alcove can load at runtime, set `ALCOVE_PLUGIN_ALLOWLIST` to a comma-separated list of approved plugin names or package roots. Unlisted plugins will not be loaded.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#plugin-system) for the plugin interface contract.

## Verticals

The gate question separates verticals into two tiers:

**Strong community tooling — plugin and go:** birding, bioacoustics, music production, podcasting, film/post-production, photography, academic research, streaming/Twitch.

**Partial coverage — some glue needed:** legal/e-discovery, journalism, real estate, insurance/claims, compliance/audit, architecture/construction.

## Building a Plugin

```toml
[project.entry-points."alcove.extractors"]
wav  = "my_audio_plugin:extract_audio"
flac = "my_audio_plugin:extract_audio"
```

Plugins are discovered at startup, override built-ins for shared extension names, and appear in `alcove plugins`. Authentication is not built into Alcove. Place it behind a reverse proxy that enforces authn/authz at the deployment boundary — OAuth, mTLS, or an API gateway all work.
