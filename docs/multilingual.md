# Multilingual Support

Status: exploratory guidance. Alcove can use the shipped sentence-transformers embedder
when `EMBEDDER=sentence-transformers` is set, but v0.4.0 does not expose public CLI flags
for selecting arbitrary model names or automatic multilingual-E5 prefix handling.

Multilingual and cross-lingual search is possible when an operator configures a suitable
embedding model through code or a plugin. No per-language tokenizers, stop-word lists, or
query parsers are required when the chosen model handles those languages.

---

## How it works

Alcove delegates language handling entirely to the embedding model. When
[`multilingual-e5-small`](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small) (or a
larger variant) is used as the embedder, query and document vectors share the same
semantic space across all supported languages. A query in English will retrieve semantically
related documents in Spanish, French, Latin, Arabic, or any of the 100+ languages the model
covers.

The asymmetric prefix convention matters:

| Input type | Required prefix |
|------------|-----------------|
| Document at ingest time | `"passage: "` |
| Query at search time | `"query: "` |

Automatic prefix handling for multilingual-E5 models is planned work, not a shipped
public contract.

## Configuring a multilingual embedder

```bash
# Install sentence-transformers
pip install sentence-transformers

# Shipped public configuration selects the sentence-transformers embedder.
EMBEDDER=sentence-transformers alcove serve

# Selecting alternate multilingual models requires custom code or a plugin today.
```

Model sizes at a glance:

| Model | Dimensions | Size | Languages |
|-------|-----------|------|-----------|
| `multilingual-e5-small` | 384 | ~110 MB | 100+ |
| `multilingual-e5-base` | 768 | ~280 MB | 100+ |
| `multilingual-e5-large` | 1024 | ~560 MB | 100+ |

## Documented community deployments

Language coverage reported by Alcove deployments:

- **English** — base case; all models perform well
- **Spanish** — Catholic primary sources, legal documents
- **Latin** — patristic texts, ecclesiastical records
- **French** — archival collections, philosophical texts
- **German** — theological and historical archives
- **Samoan**, **Ojibwe**, **Tongan** — endangered language preservation
  (see [Endangered and minority languages](#endangered-and-minority-languages))

## Endangered and minority languages

Alcove is a reasonable fit for endangered language preservation. The relevant stack:

- **Audio transcription** via [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
  for elder recordings and oral histories
- **OCR** for scanned curriculum materials and handwritten documents
- **Multilingual embeddings** for cross-document search where training data exists

The deployment model matters. An institution running Alcove on its own hardware keeps data
inside the community — no recordings, transcripts, or documents go to an external service.
This is a meaningful difference from cloud-based alternatives for communities where data
sovereignty is a concern.

## Constructed languages

[D'ni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27ni_(Myst)), [Klingon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language),
[Na'vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%27vi_language), and Tolkien's languages
([Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya), [Sindarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin))
are too sparse for semantic embeddings — the training data does not exist at the scale
these models require.

The practical approach: use metadata-only retrieval. Filter by language tag, canon status
(official vs. fan-created), and source. Full-text search over the corpus handles exact or
near-exact matches. Skip the vector index for these collections.
