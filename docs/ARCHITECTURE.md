# Architecture

The [README](../README.md) describes three stages: ingest, index, query. They are independent modules that operate over local files only. Each stage reads from disk, writes to disk, and knows nothing about the others. You can re-run any stage without touching the rest.

```
data/raw/*  →  data/processed/chunks.jsonl  →  vector store  →  query responses
```

## Ingest

`alcove/ingest` discovers files in `data/raw/**` and extracts text using format-specific extractors, then chunks the output into JSONL.

## Index

`alcove/index` reads chunks and writes embeddings plus metadata to a local vector store. ChromaDB is the default. zvec is the alternative.

## Query

`alcove/query` retrieves results via the CLI or a built-in FastAPI web service with file upload.

## Supported formats

| Format | Extension | Dependency |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Plain text | `.txt` | none |
| PDF | `.pdf` | pypdf |
| EPUB | `.epub` | ebooklib (optional) |
| HTML | `.html`, `.htm` | beautifulsoup4 |
| Markdown | `.md` | none |
| reStructuredText | `.rst` | none |
| CSV | `.csv` | none |
| TSV | `.tsv` | none |
| JSON | `.json` | none |
| JSONL | `.jsonl` | none |
| DOCX | `.docx` | python-docx (optional) |

## Embedders

| Name | Env value | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Hash (default) | `EMBEDDER=hash` | Deterministic SHA-256 hash. Offline, zero download. Useful for smoke tests and CI. |
| Sentence Transformers | `EMBEDDER=sentence-transformers` | Real semantic search via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (~80 MB model, downloaded on first use) |
| Ollama | `EMBEDDER=ollama` | Real semantic search via an operator-managed local Ollama server |

Set the embedder with the `EMBEDDER` environment variable. See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#environment-variables) for how to configure it. Custom embedders can be installed as plugins.

## Language metadata

Language detection is an indexing concern, not a retrieval dependency. During indexing,
Alcove writes a `language` metadata field for each chunk when the source chunk does not
already provide one. Query-time language filters only use stored metadata.

| Provider | Env value | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| None | `ALCOVE_LANGUAGE_PROVIDER=none` | Do not infer language metadata. Existing chunk metadata is still preserved. |
| Heuristic (default) | `ALCOVE_LANGUAGE_PROVIDER=heuristic` | Deterministic local rules for common scripts and basic English, Spanish, and French text. |
| langdetect | `ALCOVE_LANGUAGE_PROVIDER=langdetect` | Optional local library for probabilistic language ID. |
| Hugging Face | `ALCOVE_LANGUAGE_PROVIDER=transformers` or `huggingface` | Optional local `transformers` text-classification model such as `papluca/xlm-roberta-base-language-detection`. |
| Ollama | `ALCOVE_LANGUAGE_PROVIDER=ollama` | Optional local Ollama classifier. Sends sampled chunk text only to the configured Ollama base URL. |

Custom detectors can be installed as plugins through `alcove.language_detectors`.

## Vector backends

| Name | Env value | Dependency |
|------|-----------|------------|
| ChromaDB (default) | `VECTOR_BACKEND=chromadb` | chromadb (included) |
| zvec | `VECTOR_BACKEND=zvec` | zvec (optional) |

Set the backend with the `VECTOR_BACKEND` environment variable. See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#environment-variables) for how to configure it.

## Plugin system

Custom extractors, embedders, language detectors, and vector backends plug in via [Python entry points](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/). Four extension groups:

| Group | Purpose | Example entry point |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `alcove.extractors` | Add file format support | `rtf = my_plugin:extract_rtf` |
| `alcove.backends` | Add vector store backends | `pinecone = my_plugin:PineconeBackend` |
| `alcove.embedders` | Add embedding models | `openai = my_plugin:OpenAIEmbedder` |
| `alcove.language_detectors` | Add language metadata detectors | `custom = my_plugin:LanguageDetector` |

To create a plugin, add an `[project.entry-points]` section in your package's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."alcove.extractors"]
rtf = "my_plugin:extract_rtf"
```

Plugins are merged with built-ins at startup. When a plugin and a built-in share the same name, the plugin wins. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#mid-term) for planned plugin API expansion and [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for domain-specific plugin ideas and recipes.

## Boundary

The operator owns the host and the storage. Alcove makes no outbound network calls by default; the one exception is `sentence-transformers`, which downloads a model on first use and then runs locally. `EMBEDDER=ollama` and `ALCOVE_LANGUAGE_PROVIDER=ollama` send chunk text only to the Ollama base URL the operator configures, defaulting to the local loopback interface. Hugging Face language detection may download the configured model on first use, then runs locally. Telemetry is disabled, including ChromaDB's upstream telemetry. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#security-model) for the full security model.

This boundary is structural, not configurable. There is no flag to turn it off.

## Tradeoffs

The hash embedder ships as the default because it requires zero downloads and works offline. The cost is that it produces deterministic but non-semantic vectors; swap to `sentence-transformers` for real search quality.

ChromaDB is the default backend for broad compatibility and ecosystem support. Use zvec for deployments where a lighter footprint matters more than ChromaDB's feature set.

The implementation is deliberately thin. The goal at v0.3.0 is a correct, working pipeline, not an optimized one. Performance work comes after the architecture is proven.
